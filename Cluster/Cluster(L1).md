## 1. What is a Cluster?
* Imagine you have a big box of assorted candies: gummies, chocolates, and hard candies. 
* If you sort them into separate bowls based on their types, each bowl now contains candies that are more similar to each other than to candies in the other bowls. 
* Each of these bowls is like a "cluster" in the world of data â€“ a group where members are more similar to each other than to those outside the group.
